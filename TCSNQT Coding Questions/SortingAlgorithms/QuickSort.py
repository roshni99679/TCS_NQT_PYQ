'''# QuickSort

# Like Merge Sort, QuickSort is a Divide and Conquer algorithm. It picks an element as a pivot and partitions the given array around the picked pivot. There are many different versions of quickSort that pick pivot in different ways. 

# Always pick the first element as a pivot.
# Always pick the last element as a pivot (implemented below)
# Pick a random element as a pivot.
# Pick median as the pivot.
# The key process in quickSort is a partition(). The target of partitions is, given an array and an element x of an array as the pivot, put x at its correct position in a sorted array and put all smaller elements (smaller than x) before x, and put all greater elements (greater than x) after x. All this should be done in linear time.

Analysis of QuickSort 
Time taken by QuickSort, in general, can be written as follows. 

 T(n) = T(k) + T(n-k-1) + \theta              (n)

The first two terms are for two recursive calls, the last term is for the partition process. k is the number of elements that are smaller than the pivot. 
The time taken by QuickSort depends upon the input array and partition strategy. Following are three cases.

Worst Case: 
The worst case occurs when the partition process always picks the greatest or smallest element as the pivot. If we consider the above partition strategy where the last element is always picked as a pivot, the worst case would occur when the array is already sorted in increasing or decreasing order. Following is recurrence for the worst case.  

 T(n) = T(0) + T(n-1) + \theta              (n)which is equivalent to  T(n) = T(n-1) + \theta              (n)

The solution to the above recurrence is                   (n2). 

Best Case:
The best case occurs when the partition process always picks the middle element as the pivot. The following is recurrence for the best case. 

 T(n) = 2T(n/2) + \theta              (n)

The solution for the above recurrence is                  (nLogn). It can be solved using case 2 of Master Theorem.

Average Case: 
To do average case analysis, we need to consider all possible permutation of array and calculate time taken by every permutation which doesnâ€™t look easy. 
We can get an idea of average case by considering the case when partition puts O(n/9) elements in one set and O(9n/10) elements in other set. Following is recurrence for this case.  

 T(n) = T(n/9) + T(9n/10) + \theta              (n)

The solution of above recurrence is also O(nLogn):

Although the worst case time complexity of QuickSort is O(n2) which is more than many other sorting algorithms like Merge Sort and Heap Sort, QuickSort is faster in practice, because its inner loop can be efficiently implemented on most architectures, and in most real-world data. QuickSort can be implemented in different ways by changing the choice of pivot, so that the worst case rarely occurs for a given type of data. However, merge sort is generally considered better when data is huge and stored in external storage.
